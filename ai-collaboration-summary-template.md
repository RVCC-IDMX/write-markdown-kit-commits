## Key interactions

Review your SpecStory history (`.specstory/history/`) and document 3 meaningful interactions with Copilot.

### Interaction 1: [Brief title, e.g., "Learning about headers"]

**My prompt:**

> [What are the different header levels in Markdown and when should I use each one?]

**What I learned:**

[Best practices:]

[Use H1 for the document title only]
[Create a logical hierarchy (don't skip levels, e.g., H2 → H4)]
[H2-H3 are most commonly used for typical documents]
[Headers create the document outline and improve navigation]


**How I applied it:**

[Use proper about me headers]
