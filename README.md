# Week 1: Markdown fundamentals

Welcome to your first assignment using GitHub Copilot! This week you will learn Markdown—the formatting language used throughout software development and in every Copilot response.

## Learning objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

- Use Copilot Chat to ask questions and get help
- Understand how Copilot reads project files for context
- Write formatted Markdown documents
- Preview Markdown in VS Code

## Getting started

1. Open this folder in VS Code
2. Read the file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to see how Copilot has been customized for this assignment
3. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Cmd+I on Mac, Ctrl+Alt+I on Windows)
4. Start exploring!

## Assignment tasks

Complete these tasks using Copilot Chat to help you:

- [ ] Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and notice how it shapes Copilot's responses
- [ ] Study the examples in `learn-markdown.md`
- [ ] Ask Copilot to explain any Markdown syntax you do not understand
- [ ] Complete the `about-me.md` template using what you learned
- [ ] Preview your Markdown to verify it looks correct
- [ ] Create your AI collaboration summary using the template provided

## Suggested workflow

Follow this order to get the most out of the assignment:

1. **Explore the setup files first**
   - Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to understand how Copilot has been customized
   - Glance at `.vscode/settings.json` to see what workspace settings are active
   - Review `learn-dotfiles.md` to understand why these hidden files matter

2. **Learn the tools**
   - Read `learn-vscode-extensions.md` if you need help installing extensions
   - Read `learn-specstory.md` to understand how your conversations are being saved

3. **Study Markdown syntax**
   - Open `learn-markdown.md` and read through the examples
   - Open a preview pane side-by-side to see how the syntax renders
   - Ask Copilot to explain anything that is unclear

4. **Complete your about-me page**
   - Open `about-me.md` and read the template prompts
   - Fill in each section using Markdown formatting
   - Preview often to check your work
   - Ask Copilot for help when you get stuck

5. **Write your reflection**
   - Open the `.specstory/history/` folder and review your conversations (right-click files → **Open Preview** for easier reading)
   - Copy `ai-collaboration-summary-template.md` to a new file
   - Fill in the template based on your most helpful interactions

6. **Final check**
   - Preview all your Markdown files one more time
   - Make sure your repository is ready to submit

## How to preview Markdown

To see how your Markdown will look when rendered:

| Action            | Mac shortcut | Windows shortcut |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Open preview      | Cmd+Shift+V  | Ctrl+Shift+V     |
| Side-by-side view | Cmd+K V      | Ctrl+K V         |

**Easiest method**: Right-click on any `.md` file in the Explorer sidebar and select **Open Preview**.

## About the .vscode folder

The `.vscode` folder contains configuration that makes VS Code work better for this project:

- **settings.json**: Enables word wrap so long lines are easier to read, turns on auto-save so you do not lose work, and configures Markdown-specific editor behavior.

- **extensions.json**: Lists recommended extensions. When you open this folder in VS Code, you may see a prompt asking if you want to install recommended extensions. Click "Install" to add GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot Chat, and SpecStory if you do not already have them.

## Deliverables

Submit to Canvas:

1. **GitHub repository link** with your completed `about-me.md`
2. **AI collaboration summary** document (copy the template, fill it out based on your SpecStory history)

## Tips

- There are no wrong questions—ask Copilot anything about Markdown
- Try different prompts to see how Copilot responds
- Preview your work often to catch formatting issues early
- Look at `learn-markdown.md` whenever you need a quick reference
